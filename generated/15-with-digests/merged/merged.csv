This sub-study will be used to provide data to Quidel to supplement their existing EUA application for an at-home test. In this study, we will ask asymptomatic participants with known close contact to someone who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past seven days to self-administer a    Quidel QuickVue test and receive a comparator PCR test at the study site on the first day of   the study.
