Five (5) replicates were tested per dilution. The testing was performed as per the recommended instructions for use, with the virus in clinical matrix applied directly onto the Swab until the saturation of the flocked tip. The estimated LoD concentration for verification was selected as the concentration in between the dilution factor that returned 5/5 positive test outcomes (100%) and the next dilution factor that returned 0/5 positive (0%) based on the qualitative result.
