Consistent with RFA-OD-21-008, the proposed study uses the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to test four candidate intervention components grounded in our past research. The candidate components are informed by critical race theory and guided by the theory of triadic influence, are brief or do not require substantial staff time, and will be tested in a highly efficient factorial experimental design. They are A) motivational interview counseling, B) a text message component grounded in behavioral economics, C) peer education, and D) access to testing (via navigation to a test appointment vs. a self-test kit).

Its main goal is to optimize a behavioral intervention to boost COVID-19 testing rates for BLH-FEW. Consistent with RFA-OD-21-008, the proposed study uses the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to test four candidate intervention components grounded in our past research. The candidate components are informed by critical race theory and guided by the theory of triadic influence, are brief or do not require substantial staff time, and will be tested in a highly efficient factorial experimental design. They are A) motivational interview counseling, B) a text message component grounded in behavioral economics, C) peer education, and D) access to testing (via navigation to a test appointment vs. a self-test kit).
