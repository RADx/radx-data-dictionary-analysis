validation,"String that relays the validation state of the sleep data and its date range. The data could be auto-confirmed, but the sleep window could have been manually adjusted, or the sleep data itself is entirely manually entered. Possible values: MANUAL: The user entered sleep start and stop times manually through a web form. There is no device data backing up the sleep assessment. DEVICE: The user used a device with the sleep feature to manually start and stop sleep. This type still requires manual user Doubleervention to judge sleep start and stop. AUTO_TENTATIVE: The sleep start and stop times were auto-detected by Garmin Connect using accelerometer data. However, it is possible that further refinements to this sleep record will come later. This could be because the user is still asleep or could be because the user owns multiple devices and might sync another device later for this same time period. AUTO_FINAL: The sleep start and stop times were auto-detected by Garmin Connect, and enough data has been gathered to finalize the window. This status also indicates that the user only has one device so this record can never be updated again – users that own multiple devices will never get an AUTO_FINAL. AUTO_MANUAL: Sleep data was auto-detected by Garmin Connect, but the user is overriding the start and stop times or the user started with a manual entry and the sleep was auto-detected later. Garmin Connect stores both but will display the manual start and stop times in favor of the auto-detected times. ENHANCED_TENTATIVE: Sleep data was collected from a device capable of running an enhanced sleep analysis to detect REM sleep, but an updated sleep summary record may come later with further refinements or a greater sleep period. ENHANCED_FINAL: Sleep data was collected from a device capable of running an enhanced sleep analysis to detect REM sleep, and no further updates or refinements to this sleep analysis are expected.",string,data_dictionary.xlsx [Garmin Intraday Sleep].csv,RADx-DHT,bfbd7bbeaafa37565821d1a8d0cfe5d7243f934f6deb06cb4f635272df08bc69f99dbd4939e10b5493cb8c2b9e7628c276d4264858fbcb08efdab2467f4f76be
